# IR.NET

Originally created by Scott Przybylski http://members.iracing.com/jforum/posts/list/1474031.page

Then modified and released as a .netstandard & net 5.0 project by https://github.com/SlevinthHeaven/irsdkSharp

Now further modified by myself for my personal projects.

## Usage
- Simply install the latest version of `IR.NET` on NuGet.
- Add the `iRacing` namespace to your class.
- You can use the dashboard example project `IRNET.Example` to help get started.
